# Know Your Trees

I would like to implement decision trees algorithms in rust. First thing first, to learn rust.
Secondly, to go through decision trees algrithms in more depth as I use them a lot at work.

## Action Plan

Ideally I would like to implement everything, from id3 to boosting ensembles, but let's define the priorities:

- [ ] CART trees
    - [x] numerical features
    - [ ] categorical features
    - [ ] symmetric trees
- [ ] ID
- [ ] C45
- [ ] Ensembles:
    - [ ] random forests
    - [ ] boosting
